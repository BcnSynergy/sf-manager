# Delta for Authorization

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Permission Check on Community and Assignment Endpoints

The system MUST check the caller's role before allowing access to any
`/communities` endpoint and any of its representative/technician
assignment sub-resource endpoints. Only `SYSTEM_ADMIN` MUST be
permitted; the other 4 roles MUST be rejected even though they are
valid enum values. Authentication MUST be evaluated before this
check: a request without a valid session MUST receive 401 even if the
requested action would otherwise require role rejection (403). The
new permissions are additive to the `Permission` union and are
granted only on the `SYSTEM_ADMIN` row of `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`; the
other 4 roles (`MANAGER`, `MAINTENANCE_COMPANY_MANAGER`,
`MAINTENANCE_TECHNICIAN`, `COMMUNITY_REPRESENTATIVE`) remain `[]` —
holding an active community assignment grants no permission.

#### Scenario: SYSTEM_ADMIN is permitted
- GIVEN an authenticated caller with role `SYSTEM_ADMIN`
- WHEN they call a `/communities` endpoint or an assignment sub-resource endpoint
- THEN the request MUST proceed to the endpoint's own logic

#### Scenario: Non-admin role is rejected
- GIVEN an authenticated caller whose role is any of `MANAGER`, `MAINTENANCE_COMPANY_MANAGER`, `MAINTENANCE_TECHNICIAN`, or `COMMUNITY_REPRESENTATIVE`
- WHEN they call a `/communities` endpoint or an assignment sub-resource endpoint
- THEN the response MUST be 403, regardless of any active community assignment the caller may hold

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated caller is rejected before role check
- GIVEN no valid session (no cookie, expired, or tampered token)
- WHEN the caller calls a `/communities` endpoint or an assignment sub-resource endpoint
- THEN the response MUST be 401, and the permission check MUST NOT execute
